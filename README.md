# Kruiser-Web-Browser
Kruiser is a fast and lightweight Browser that (might) fit on a floppy disk. It's chromium-based because gecko is really hard, but we aim to de-google it in the future and use DuckDuckGo instead (maybe in the next update). This project was developed by ladsalt, and so far I haven't written a single line of code for it, but plan to in the future.
